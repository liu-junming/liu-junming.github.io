<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Junming Liu (刘君茗). I am a PhD student in <a href="https://mpi-softsec.github.io">MPI Software Security group</a> led by <a href="https://mboehme.github.io">Dr. Marcel Böhme</a> at <a href="https://www.mpi-sp.org">Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP)</a>. <br>Previously, I got my Master's degree from <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn">Zhejiang University</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/wangweihai">Prof. Wenhai Wang</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests are in Large Language Models for Software Security, Software Engineering, and Program Analysis. I focus on improving the effectiveness and quality of the entire vulnerability management lifecycle, with two key aspects: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Advancing vulnerability management technologies, including vulnerability detection, automated fixing, patch correctness assessment, and more. </li>
  <li>Understanding the broader societal and community impacts of vulnerabilities. </li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve these goals, I am interested in exploring the use of machine learning, static analysis, and other techniques to enhance vulnerability management. I also seek to assess how these tools can improve both technical efficiency and the human-centered understanding of vulnerabilities.</p>
